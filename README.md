## react-motion-ui-pack 0.0.2

Addon component wrappers for common UI transitions.

## Note

This isn't ready for production use yet, working as fast as I can to get some usable wrappers and demos up. Please file an issue if you want to see anything special make it's way into this repo.

## TODOS:

- [ ] fix transition out
- [x] add browser prefixing
